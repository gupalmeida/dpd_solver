# NUMERICAL METHODS
Repository with useful numerical methods solvers and features for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) problems. The methods implemented will be briefly described and more references will be provided for further reading. The numerical schemes are implemented for either Finite Volume Method (FVM) or Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) as part of my Ph.D. work in progress.

Source code and features implemented using Python 3.6.9.

## DISSIPATIVE PARTICLE DYNAMICS
The DPD method is a particle-based numerical method derived from the Molecular Dynamics, in which the interaction between particles is computed from conservative, dissipative and random forces acting on each particle.

The DPD method is obiviously not unique. The method have evolved from its first development by Hoogerbrugge and Koelman. However, the justifications for each new feature and algorithm modification can be easily found in the literature.
