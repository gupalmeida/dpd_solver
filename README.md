# DISSIPATIVE PARTICLE DYNAMICS
Repository with Dissipative Prticle Dynamics solver and features. Source code and features implemented using Python 3.6.9.

## Introduction
The DPD method is a particle-based numerical method derived from the Molecular Dynamics, in which the interaction between particles is computed from conservative, dissipative and random forces acting on each particle.

The DPD method is obiviously not unique. The method have evolved from its first development by Hoogerbrugge and Koelman. However, the justifications for each new feature and algorithm modification can be easily found in the literature.
