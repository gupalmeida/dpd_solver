# TODO LIST
This list has a simple purpose to guide me throughout the development of the code. The list will be constantly updated and items should be included and/or modified.

## Let's do it...
- [x] Write IO function to read variable from input file
- [ ] Identify input variables for DPD simulation and update input file
- [ ] Generate computational simple computational 2-D computational domain
- [ ] Distribute all the N particles inside computational domain and apply initial conditions
- [ ] Implement computation of forces along every particle in the domain
- [ ] Implement time-marching method
